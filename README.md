# Building and Running Eristic iOS App in Xcode

## Prerequisites:
- Make sure you have a Mac or MacBook with an M1 processor.
- Install Xcode 15.0.1 or a later version on your macOS Sonoma (14.1) from Apple's App Store.
- Ensure your iPhone is an iPhone 12 or newer and has iOS 17.1.2 installed.

## Steps:

1. **Download Eristic:**
   - Download the Eristic.zip folder from the provided source.

2. **Unzip the Folder:**
   - Locate the downloaded Eristic.zip file and unzip it.

3. **Open Xcode Project:**
   - Inside the unzipped folder, find and double-click on the file named `Eristic.xcodeproj`. This will open the project in Xcode.

4. **Xcode Interface:**
   - Once Xcode is open, you'll see the project's files and folders on the left side (Navigator column). Click on 'Project' (cmd + 1) to see the project structure.

5. **Select Build Target:**
   - In the top bar of Xcode, you should see 'Eristic > <Device>' which represents the app and the build target. Choose your build target:
     - For testing in Xcode Simulator (Not recommended): Select 'Eristic > iPhone 15 Pro Max'.
     - For testing on an actual device (iPhone 12 or newer): Connect your iPhone to your Mac.

6. **Build and Run in Xcode Simulator (Optional):**
   - If you're testing in Xcode Simulator:
     - Hit the run button (Play button) in the top left corner or press cmd + R.
     - A virtual device will be built on your Mac, representing an iPhone. Note that Xcode Simulator is not ideal for real use, but it's useful for design and testing purposes.

7. **Build and Run on an Actual Device:**
   - If you're testing on your iPhone:
     - Connect your iPhone to your Mac.
     - Trust the host Mac on your iPhone when prompted.
     - From the top bar in Xcode, select your iPhone from the drop-down menu.
     - Hit the run button (Play button) in the top left corner or press cmd + R.
     - If prompted, trust the developer on your iPhone (Settings/General/VPN & Device Management).

8. **Enjoy Eristic:**
   - The app will launch on your selected device, and you can interact with its features.

These steps should guide someone unfamiliar with Xcode through the process of building and running the Eristic iOS app. If there are any issues or questions, feel free to ask for further assistance.
